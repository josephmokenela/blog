# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# I was trying to put the seed data here but I get an error, decided to comment it out for now.
#user = User.create(:email => "dev.mmjmicrosystems.com", :password => "pass")

#Category.create [{:name => 'Education'}, {:name => 'Fashion'}, {:name => 'Health'},
  #{:name => 'Technology'}, {:name => 'Business'}, {:name => 'General'}]
